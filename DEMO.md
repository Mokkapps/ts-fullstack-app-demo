# Building Full-Stack TypeScript Applications

# Introduction

1. Why a TS full-stack app?
    * Share code (like domain models) between frontend and backend
    * Use the same programming language & testing library in frontend and backend application 
    
    More details can be found in [this blog post](https://www.mokkapps.de/blog/nest-js-the-missing-piece-to-easily-develop-full-stack-typescript-web-applications/)

2. TypeScript
    * [Official website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
    * **!!! TYPES !!!**
    * Superset of JavaScript
3. NestJS

    Nest is a Node.js framework designed for building scalable
    server-side applications. In many ways, Nest is familiar to Angular
    developers:

    - It has excellent TypeScript support.
    - Its dependency injection system is similar to the one in Angular.
    - It emphasises testability.
    - Its configuration APIs are similar to Angular as well.
    - It uses annotations like used in SpringBoot etc.

    Many conventions and best practices used in Angular applications can be also be used in Nest.

4. Angular
    * [Official website](https://angular.io)
    * From prototype through global deployment, Angular delivers the productivity and scalable infrastructure that supports Google's largest applications. 
5. Nx

    It is a "monorepo" way of building applications.

    ### Prettier, Jest and Cypress per default

    Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. An Nx workspace comes with Prettier preconfigured.

    Jest is a fast 0-setup testing framework from Facebook.

    By default, Nx uses Jest for both Angular and Node.js applications. 

    Cypress is an e2e test runner built for modern web. It has a lot of great features:

    - Time travel
    - Real time reloads
    - Automatic waiting
    - Spies, stubs, and clocks
    - Network traffic control
    - Screenshots and videos

    NICE: By default, when creating a new Angular application, Nx will use Cypress to create the e2e tests project.

6. Demo

# Step by step 

## Add empty workspace

    npx create-nx-workspace@latest ts-fullstack-app-demo
    cd ts-fullstack-app-demo

## Add Angular frontend application

    ng add @nrwl/angular # Add Angular Capabilities to the workspace
    ng g @nrwl/angular:application frontend # Create an Angular Application

Now we can run:

- `ng serve frontend` to serve the application
- `ng build frontend` to build the application
- `ng test frontend` to test the application

- Add HttpClientModule to app.module.ts
- Implement API access in app.component.ts and app.component.html:

        export interface Dog {
        	imageUrl: string;
        }
        
        export class AppComponent {
          dog$: Observable<Dog[]>;
        
          constructor(http: HttpClient) {
            this.dog$ = http.get<Dog[]>('/api/dogs');
          }
        }

        <img *ngFor="let dog of (dog$ | async)" src="{{ dog.imageUrl }}" alt="Any dog image" />

## Add Nest.js backend application

    ng add @nrwl/nest # Add Node Capabilities to the workspace
    ng g @nrwl/nest:application api --frontend-project frontend # sets up the proxy configuration so you can access the API in development

Now we can run:

- `ng serve api` to serve the backend application
- `ng build api` to build the backend application
- `ng test api` to test the backend application

### Adding the dogs endpoint

- We use this amazing API: [https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/random](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/random)
- Add HttpModule to app.module.ts (uses Axios behind the scenes)
- Add API call to app.service.ts

        constructor(private readonly httpService: HttpService) {}
        
        getDogs(){
            return this.httpService.get('[https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/10](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/10)').pipe(map(res => res.data.message.map(m => {
        			return { imageUrl: m };
        		});
          }

- Add service call and endpoint to app.component.ts

        @Get('dogs')
        getDogs(): Observable<Dog[]> {
        	return this.appService.getDogs();
        }

    Run 

        ng serve frontend & ng serve api

## Share code between frontend and backend

Problem: Dog interface is defined twice

Solution: Share interface in monorepo via library

Normally sharing code between the backend and the frontend would have required days of work, but with Nx, itâ€™s done in just minutes. 

In Nx, code is shared by creating libraries. 

Because everything is in a single repository, libraries can be imported without having to publish them to a registry.

Create a new library:

    ng g @nrwl/workspace:library data # This generates a barebone library with only Typescript setup

Next, move Dog into `libs/data/src/lib/data.ts`:

    export interface Dog {
      imageUrl: string;
    }

Update the frontend and the backend to import the interface from the library.

    import { Dog } from '@ts-fullstack-app/data';

After this refactor, the backend and the frontend will share the same definition of Ticket and never get out of sync. Being able to factor code into a lot of small libraries with a well-defined public API, which you can then use across both the backend and the frontend, is a key feature of Nx.

## Visualise dependency graph

    npm run dep-graph

## Add Swagger

The [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) (Swagger) specification is a powerful definition format to describe RESTful APIs. Nest provides a dedicated [module](https://github.com/nestjs/swagger) to work with it.

    npm install --save @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express

Add swagger configuration to `main.ts` of api application:

```typescript
  // Add Swagger
  const options = new DocumentBuilder()
    .setTitle('Dogs API')
    .setDescription('The Dogs API description')
    .setVersion('1.0')
    .addTag('dogs')
    .build();
  const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, options);
  SwaggerModule.setup('api/help', app, document);
```

Swagger docs are then available at `http://localhost:4200/api/help/`
