# Demo for a full-stack TypeScript application

This demo was developed to demonstrate how to a full-stack TypeScript application could be bootstrapped. 

It uses 
    * [Nx](https://nx.dev), which a set of Angular CLI power-ups for modern development
    * [Angular](https://angular.io) for the frontend application
    * [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com) for a Node.js based backend application

Demo instructions are located at `DEMO.md`.

This demo was inspired by the official [Nx guide](https://nx.dev/fundamentals/build-full-stack-applications).
